# Clutch Performance Analysis in High-Stakes Matches

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze soccer players' performance in high-pressure situations, such as playoff matches or derby games, to identify individuals who excel under pressure referred to as "clutch" players. By examining performance metrics and, when available, psychological data, we aim to uncover key factors contributing to clutch performance.

### Objectives
- Develop machine learning models to classify players as "clutch" or "non-clutch."
- Use clustering techniques to group players with similar clutch performance patterns.
- (Optional) Apply sentiment analysis to player interviews or surveys for psychological insights.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
**Primary Data:**
- **Player Performance Metrics:** Goals, assists, tackles, interceptions, shots, passes, etc.
- **Game Context:** Match type, team ranking, and home vs. away games.
- **Player Information:** Age, experience, position, and historical performance in high-stakes games.

**Data Sources:** Datasets from FBref, Opta, or other publicly available soccer databases.

**Optional Data:**
- **Psychological Metrics:** Pre-game interview sentiments or surveys analyzed using NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, Hugging Face).

### Machine Learning Techniques
- **Classification Models:** Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost to label players as "clutch" or "non-clutch."
- **Clustering:** k-means and hierarchical clustering to group players with similar clutch traits.
- **Sentiment Analysis (Optional):** Use NLP to analyze player sentiments from interviews.

## Deliverables
- A trained machine learning model for identifying clutch players.
- Code and documentation for data processing, model building, and clustering.
- A comprehensive report detailing:
  - Key factors contributing to clutch performance.
  - Profiles of players identified as clutch.
  - Insights derived from performance metrics and psychological data.

## Challenges and Risks
- **Data Availability:** Difficulty obtaining reliable psychological or sentiment data.
- **NLP Complexity:** Implementing sentiment analysis with limited data may require significant resources.
- **Timeline:** Coordinating data processing, modeling, and analysis within the project timeline.
